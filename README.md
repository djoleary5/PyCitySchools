The task is to help the  school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities by analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. My responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Data
A set of data for each school in the district called [schools_complete.csv](py_city_schools/Resources/schools_complete.csv), which is composed of five columns: `School ID`, `school_name`, `type`, and `budget`.
And a set of data for each stucent in the district called [sstudents_complete.csv](py_city_schools/Resources/students_complete.csv), which is composed of seven columns: `Student ID`, `student_name`, `gender`, `grade`, `school_name`, `reading_score` and `math_score`.
The passing score is 70 or greater for both the math and reading exams.
