    "Schools with higher per-student budgets did not yeild higher test scores.  More analysis is required as to the reason for this.  It is possible that students with special needs would require a higher budget and would not necessarily score higher on standardized tests.\n",

    "Small and medium size schools produced similar test scores and large schools (over 2000 students) were significantly lower.\n",

    "Charter schools test scores were significantly higher than district schools.  This is to be expected as many times charter schools are able to cherry-pick the best students from the district.\n"
